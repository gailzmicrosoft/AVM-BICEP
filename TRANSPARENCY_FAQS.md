# Code Gen Accelerator: Responsible AI FAQ  

## What is the Code Gen Accelerator?  
The Code Gen Accelerator is an open-source GitHub repository designed to convert Informix files into T-SQL using AI-powered automation. The accelerator dynamically generates agents to complete code conversion tasks while maintaining transparency and control.  

## What can the Code Gen Accelerator do?  
This solution accelerator enhances enterprise workflows by automating database migration. It integrates with existing systems, allowing AI agents to handle complex conversions while ensuring user oversight and control.  

## What is the intended use of the Code Gen Accelerator?  
This repository is a solution accelerator, following open-source licensing terms. It is designed to demonstrate AI-powered database conversion and provide users with a structured workflow for automated code migration.  

## How is the Code Gen Accelerator evaluated?  
The evaluation process includes human review of outputs and fine-tuned LLM prompts for accuracy. Users can modify prompts to align with their specific use cases and business needs.  

## What are the limitations of the Code Gen Accelerator?  
- Users should review AI-generated outputs and make necessary refinements.  
- The accelerator relies on AI models and may require fine-tuning for edge cases.  
- AutoGen limitations apply, as outlined [here](https://github.com/microsoft/autogen/blob/gaia_multiagent_v01_march_1st/TRANSPARENCY_FAQS.md#what-are-the-limitations-of-autogen-how-can-users-minimize-the-impact-of-autogens-limitations-when-using-the-system).  

## How can users ensure responsible and effective use?  
- Users should verify AI-generated outputs before deployment.  
- Responsible AI usage guidelines should be followed, including:  
  - [OpenAI Usage Policies](https://openai.com/policies/usage-policies/)  
  - [Azure OpenAI Code of Conduct](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/legal/cognitive-services/openai/code-of-conduct)  
- Caching is enabled by default to improve reliability and reduce cost.
